jQuery Additions:
01. welcome fade
- when page loaded, the welcome text will fade in
> i added this because i wanted a simple animation to play when you first enter the page. this may excite the user, and they might be more inclined to stay on the page
02. toggle opacity & text when hover
- when you hover over the nav buttons under the images, the opacity of the image will decrease by 50% & text will appear. when taking your mouse off of the button, the opacity will return to normal & the text will hide
> i added this because i wanted to make my home page more interactive since it was a bit dull. the text descriptions also let users know what each page will contain.
